\# Part A: Agent Blueprints & Patterns

\#\# Chapter 1: The Standard Development Environment

\*\*Chapter Primer\*\*    
\*Synopsis:\* This chapter establishes the baseline architecture for secure and consistent agentic development using Devcontainers, providing the foundational environment for all subsequent blueprints.    
\*Key Concepts:\* Devcontainer isolation, reproducibility, least-privilege security, dependency management, centralised configuration.    
\*For the Beginner:\* Learn the simple steps to set up a safe, consistent workspace that protects your system while enabling agentic tools.    
\*For the Expert:\* Understand the architectural rationale for Devcontainers as the canonical security model, including advanced troubleshooting and integration patterns for enterprise-scale deployments.

\#\#\# 1.1 The Recommended Architecture: Why We Use Devcontainers  
Devcontainers are the canonical approach for security and consistency, providing isolated, reproducible environments with non-root execution and controlled dependencies. Why: They eliminate "works on my machine" issues by enforcing immutable bases and pinned versions, harden supply chains against vulnerabilities (e.g., via SBOM generation), and enable least-privilege principles by mounting projects read-only with writable temps. This prevents unintended file access or environmental drift, crucial for agentic systems where autonomy could amplify errors. Alternatives like native installs are for niche cases but lack built-in isolation, increasing risks of tool misuse or data leakage in production workflows.

\#\#\# 1.2 Setting Up Your First Devcontainer for Claude Code  
\`\`\`json  
// .devcontainer/devcontainer.json  
{  
  "name": "Claude Code Dev",  
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",  
  "features": {"node": "lts"},  
  "postCreateCommand": "npm install \-g @anthropic-ai/claude-code",  
  "customizations": {"vscode": {"extensions": \["anthropic.claude-code"\]}}  
}  
\`\`\`  
Build with VS Code Dev Containers extension. Why this setup: Ensures consistent tooling; post-command installs Claude Code securely, while features pin dependencies to avoid drift.

\#\#\# 1.3 Creating a Centralised, Version-Controlled Agent Configuration (\`\~/.claude\_agents\`)  
Create \`\~/.claude\_agents\` for commands/hooks; git init for versioning. Why: Enables traceability and collaboration—commit changes to configs like CLAUDE.md for auditability and rollback, essential for team environments where agent behaviours evolve.

\#\#\# 1.4 Troubleshooting Common Devcontainer Issues  
Issues: Docker compatibility—ensure Desktop installed. Solutions: For auth errors, use host borrowing; for permissions, \`--allowedTools\`. Why troubleshooting matters: Maintains operational reliability in agentic setups, where failures could cascade.

\#\# Chapter 2: Blueprint: The Automated Documenter Agent

\*\*Chapter Primer\*\*    
\*Synopsis:\* This chapter details a blueprint for an agent that automatically generates and maintains project documentation, encapsulating code analysis and Markdown formatting logic.    
\*Key Concepts:\* Context gathering, custom slash commands, output sanitisation, documentation coverage metrics.    
\*For the Beginner:\* Discover how to create an agent that turns code into readable docs without manual effort.    
\*For the Expert:\* Explore patterns for robust context provision and integration with CI/CD for continuous documentation.

\*\*Objective & Success Criteria:\*\* Generate comprehensive, accurate documentation for codebases, achieving 95% coverage of functions/classes, measurable via output completeness and user verification.
