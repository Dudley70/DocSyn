### 2. Claude Code Automation Validation üéØ HIGH
- [ ] Test standard execution pattern with timeout management
- [ ] Verify authentication status and tool permissions
- [ ] Validate JSON output parsing for programmatic use
- [ ] Test background execution with progress monitoring
- [ ] Document any execution failures or timeout issues

### 3. CI & Protections Setup üéØ IMMEDIATE
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- [ ] Add workflow steps: make docsyn, verify_baseline.py, qa_build.py
- [ ] Create CODEOWNERS file to protect curated paths
- [ ] Enable branch protection on main (require PR + green checks)
- [ ] Test workflow with a small PR

### 4. Agent Blueprint Testing & Validation üéØ HIGH  
**Status:** Ready - All blueprints documented, need operational testing

**Blueprints to Test:**
- [ ] Automated Documenter - Test context gathering and Markdown generation
- [ ] Guardian File-Watcher - Test fswatch integration and cooldown logic
- [ ] Janitor File-Management - Test HITL approval workflow and safety checks
- [ ] Automated Tester - Test framework detection and coverage reporting  
- [ ] CI/CD Security Analyst - Test SARIF generation and PR integration
