# DocSyn Project Tasks & Priorities

## Current Priority: CI & Protections Setup ‚ö°
**Status:** Ready - v1.1.1 tagged, need GitHub Actions and CODEOWNERS  
**Next Action:** Set up GitHub Actions workflow and protect main branch  
**Why:** Ensure system integrity for future changes  
**Time:** 30 minutes

## Active Work Queue

- [x] Updated banner from "Single Source of Truth" to "DocSyn Compiled Knowledge"
- [x] Updated assemble_ssot.py, ci_validate.py, one_click_repair_and_build.py
- [x] Updated STATUS.md references
- [x] Tested full CI pipeline - all functional
- [x] Removed old SSOT.md file cleanly

### 1.7. [x] Merge & Tag v1.1.1 ‚ö° COMPLETE
- [x] Committed all verified changes to cleanup/next-batch
- [x] Merged to main branch with fast-forward
- [x] Verified clean build on main (all 22 verification points pass)
- [x] Baseline verification confirmed (SHA256: 2cb6b5cf matches)
- [x] Tagged v1.1.1 with comprehensive release notes
- [x] Updated STATUS.md to reflect tagged release state
- [x] System ready for CI setup and protection

### 2. CI & Protections Setup ‚ö° IMMEDIATE
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- [ ] Add workflow steps: make docsyn, verify_baseline.py, qa_build.py
- [ ] Create CODEOWNERS file to protect curated paths
- [ ] Enable branch protection on main (require PR + green checks)
- [ ] Test workflow with a small PR

### 3. Claude Code Automation Validation üéØ HIGH  
**Status:** Ready - All blueprints documented, need operational testing

**Blueprints to Test:**
- [ ] Automated Documenter - Test context gathering and Markdown generation
- [ ] Guardian File-Watcher - Test fswatch integration and cooldown logic
- [ ] Janitor File-Management - Test HITL approval workflow and safety checks
- [ ] Automated Tester - Test framework detection and coverage reporting  
- [ ] CI/CD Security Analyst - Test SARIF generation and PR integration
- [ ] Adaptive Learning - Test feedback loop and configuration updates
- [ ] Multi-Agent Orchestrator - Test parallel execution and handoff patterns

### 4. Router System Enhancement üìù HIGH
- [ ] Validate query-pattern matching for all 7 intent types
- [ ] Test negative pattern filtering effectiveness
- [ ] Add performance metrics for routing accuracy
- [ ] Document routing decision logic and edge cases

### 5. Risk & Control Validation üéØ MEDIUM
- [ ] Test all documented mitigations for each risk pillar
- [ ] Validate HITL checkpoints in destructive operations
- [ ] Test circuit breakers and timeout mechanisms
- [ ] Audit logging implementation across all agents

### 6. Development Environment Setup üìù MEDIUM
- [ ] Test devcontainer configuration for reproducibility
- [ ] Validate least-privilege security model
- [ ] Test ~/.claude_agents configuration versioning
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures for common issues

## Blocked/Waiting Items

### Agent Implementation Dependencies
- **Blocker:** Need to verify Claude Code execution environment is properly configured
- **Action:** Run authentication test and validate tool permissions

### Multi-Agent Testing
- **Blocker:** Requires robust queue system for production (Redis/Celery mentioned)
- **Action:** Determine if simplified testing approach is sufficient for validation

## Backlog (Future Work)

### Enhanced Automation
- [ ] Implement MCP server integrations for extended functionality
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboards for agent performance metrics
- [ ] Create automated testing suite for all agent patterns
- [ ] Develop agent composition patterns for complex workflows

### Documentation Improvements  
- [ ] Add video tutorials for each agent blueprint
- [ ] Create troubleshooting decision trees
- [ ] Develop best practices guide for agent customization
- [ ] Add security audit checklist for production deployments

### Integration Patterns
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration templates
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline security scanning automation
- [ ] Multi-repository orchestration patterns
- [ ] Enterprise-scale deployment guides

## Task Management Rules
- ‚ö° IMMEDIATE: Do today
- üéØ HIGH: This week  
- üìù MEDIUM: This month
- Use [ ] for incomplete, [x] for complete
- Move completed items to DECISIONS.md if they resulted in architectural choices
- Keep this file current - remove completed items regularly
