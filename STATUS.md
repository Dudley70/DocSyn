# DocSyn Project Status

## Current System State
**Phase:** Document Synthesis System - Ready for Next Batch  
**Key Components:** 
- Document Synthesiser: Takes multiple documents (any topic) as input
- Processing scripts: Convert raw sources → curated sections → single compiled output
- System ready for next document batch processing
- Output: dist/DocSyn_Compiled.md for integration

**Last Validated:** 2025-09-09  
**Status:** Working - Comprehensive documentation system with auto-consolidation

## Next Action
**IMMEDIATE:** Ready for next document batch  
**PRIORITY:** High  
**ESTIMATED TIME:** Ready to process new documents

**COMPLETED:** 
- Staging cleaner integration - System now self-healing for duplicate files
- Output file rename - Legacy → DocSyn_Compiled.md for clarity
- Claude Code batch processing and system cleanup

## Recovery Information
**Environment:** Document synthesis system  
**Dependencies:** 
- Python 3 with file processing libraries
- UTF-8 encoding support
- Git for version control
- Make for build automation
- JSON processing utilities

**Configuration:** 
- Three-file documentation system (STATUS.md, TASKS.md, DECISIONS.md)
- Makefile targets for build automation
- Baseline verification system
- Deterministic build process

**Restart Commands:**
```bash
# Process new document batch
make docsyn

# Verify deterministic output
make verify

# Check system status
cat STATUS.md
```

## Essential Files
**Core Components:**
- DocSyn_Compiled.md - Auto-generated consolidation of all documentation
- Build system - Promotion, assembly, and validation pipeline
- Quality gates - Baseline verification and deterministic builds

**Documentation Structure:**
- blueprints/ - Curated content modules
- merge_pr/updated/ - Staging area for new documents
- reference/ - Technical specifications and templates
- core/ - Global sections and system components

**System Components:**
1. Document Synthesis - Multi-source compilation and deduplication
2. Staging Management - File promotion and validation
3. Build Pipeline - Assembly, verification, and output generation
4. Quality Gates - Baseline verification and deterministic builds
5. Cleanup System - Automatic duplicate detection and removal
