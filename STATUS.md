# DocSyn Project Status

## Current System State
**Phase:** Production-Ready Hybrid Documentation System with Operational Polish  
**Key Components:** 
- Document Synthesiser: Vendor-neutral core + vendor-specific appendix architecture
- Policy-aware QA: Intelligent handling of vendor-specific vs. neutral content
- Operational Tools: Curated sources index + manifest integrity validation
- Processing scripts: Raw sources → staged promotion → curated compilation → single output
- Output: dist/DocSyn_Compiled.md with comprehensive agent documentation + curation index

**Last Validated:** 2025-09-09  
**Status:** Working - v1.2.1 operational polish completed with self-documenting curation system

## Next Action
**IMMEDIATE:** CI & Protections Setup  
**PRIORITY:** High  
**ESTIMATED TIME:** 2 hours

**COMPLETED v1.2.1:** Operational polish with curation index and manifest guard
**COMPLETED:** Claude Code automation validation with comprehensive system testing

**COMPLETED:** 
- ✅ Staging cleaner integration - System now self-healing for duplicate files
- ✅ Output file rename - Legacy → DocSyn_Compiled.md for clarity
- ✅ Claude Code batch processing and system cleanup
- ✅ Policy-aware QA system - Vendor-specific content properly handled
- ✅ Hybrid approach implementation - Core vendor-neutral, vendor docs allowed under policy
- ✅ Vendor appendix integration - 5 Claude-specific blueprints (265KB) added with clear separation
- ✅ Quality gates maintained - All validation passing with deterministic builds
- ✅ Documentation updates - All files updated to reflect v1.2.0 hybrid architecture
- ✅ v1.2.1 Operational Polish - Curated sources index + manifest guard with deterministic output

## Recovery Information
**Environment:** Document synthesis system  
**Dependencies:** 
- Python 3 with file processing libraries
- UTF-8 encoding support
- Git for version control
- Make for build automation
- JSON processing utilities

**Configuration:** 
- Three-file documentation system (STATUS.md, TASKS.md, DECISIONS.md)
- Policy-aware QA with vendor-specific content classification
- Hybrid build manifest: 17 curated sources (4 core + 13 blueprints)
- Operational tools: gen-curation-index, manifest-guard integrated in QA
- Makefile targets for build automation
- Baseline verification system (hash: a9655f5a)
- Deterministic build process with vendor content support + manifest validation

**Restart Commands:**
```bash
# Process new document batch
make docsyn

# Verify deterministic output  
make verify

# Run quality assurance with policy awareness
make qa

# Check system status
cat STATUS.md
```

## Essential Files
**Core Components:**
- DocSyn_Compiled.md - Auto-generated consolidation: vendor-neutral core + vendor appendix
- Policy-aware QA system - Distinguishes vendor-specific (allowed) vs. neutral (enforced) content
- Build system - Promotion, assembly, and validation pipeline with hybrid content support
- Quality gates - Baseline verification (8d4125c5) and deterministic builds

**Documentation Architecture:**
- core/ - Vendor-neutral sections: router, risks, devcontainer, appendix header (4 files)
- blueprints/ - Universal patterns + vendor examples: 7 neutral + 8 vendor-specific (15 files total)
- build.manifest.json - 16 curated sources with explicit vendor content inclusion
- Front-matter classification: `policy: vendor-specific` and `anchor: true` support

**Hybrid Content Structure:**
```
Core (Vendor-Neutral):
├── Router & Risk Framework  
├── Development Environment
├── Universal Agent Blueprints (7 anchor files)

Appendix (Vendor-Specific):
├── Claude Agent Framework (46KB)
├── Claude AI Coding Guide (63KB)
├── Claude Code Bible (123KB) 
├── Code Assistant Patterns (33KB)
└── Deployment Agent Guide (27KB)
```

**System Components:**
1. Document Synthesis - Multi-source compilation with vendor-neutral/vendor-specific separation
2. Policy-Aware QA - Classification system for vendor vs. neutral content validation  
3. Staging Management - File promotion and validation with duplicate detection
4. Build Pipeline - Assembly, verification, and deterministic output generation
5. Quality Gates - Baseline verification, forbidden terms checking, and architectural integrity
6. Cleanup System - Automatic duplicate detection and staging area maintenance
7. Hybrid Content Management - Unified system supporting both universal patterns and vendor examples
