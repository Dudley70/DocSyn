# DocSyn Project Status

## Current System State
**Phase:** v1.1.1 Tagged Release - All Systems Verified ✅  
**Key Components:** 
- Document Synthesiser: Auto-anchor creation with HITL router suggestions
- QA Guardrails: Forbidden terms, baseline verify, structural integrity checks
- Deterministic builds: UTF-8/NFC normalization, reproducible outputs (SHA256: 2cb6b5cf)
- Production ready: 22/22 verification points passing

**Last Validated:** 2025-09-09  
**Status:** Tagged v1.1.1 - Structural recovery complete, ready for any document set

## Next Action
**IMMEDIATE:** Ready for next document batch  
**PRIORITY:** High  
**ESTIMATED TIME:** Ready to process new documents

**COMPLETED:** 
- Staging cleaner integration - System now self-healing for duplicate files
- Output file rename - Legacy → DocSyn_Compiled.md for clarity
- Claude Code batch processing and system cleanup

## Recovery Information
**Environment:** Document synthesis system  
**Dependencies:** 
- Python 3 with file processing libraries
- UTF-8 encoding support
- Git for version control
- Make for build automation
- JSON processing utilities

**Configuration:** 
- Three-file documentation system (STATUS.md, TASKS.md, DECISIONS.md)
- Makefile targets for build automation
- Baseline verification system
- Deterministic build process

**Restart Commands:**
```bash
# Process new document batch
make docsyn

# Verify deterministic output
make verify

# Check system status
cat STATUS.md
```

## Essential Files
**Core Components:**
- DocSyn_Compiled.md - Auto-generated consolidation of all documentation
