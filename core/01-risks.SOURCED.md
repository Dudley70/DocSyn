### Unified Risk & Control Model

## Risk & Control Framework

| Risk Category | Description | Primary Controls | Residual Risk Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Data integrity | Unintended corruption or loss of data during processing. | Backup systems; validation checks; atomic operations; version control; checksums. | Regular integrity audits; recovery procedures tested. |
| Process failure | System failures or unexpected behavior during document processing. | Error handling; retry logic; graceful degradation; monitoring; alerting. | Automated recovery where possible; manual intervention procedures. |
| Security breach | Unauthorized access to sensitive documents or systems. | Access controls; encryption; authentication; audit logging; least privilege. | Regular security reviews; incident response procedures. |
| Quality degradation | Poor output quality or incorrect document processing. | Validation rules; quality gates; human review; testing; baseline verification. | Continuous quality monitoring; feedback loops. |
| Resource exhaustion | System overload or resource depletion. | Resource limits; monitoring; scaling; throttling; circuit breakers. | Capacity planning; performance optimization. |
| Configuration drift | Unintended changes to system configuration. | Configuration management; immutable infrastructure; change control; documentation. | Regular configuration audits; automated compliance checks. |
